# 🚀 AI Story Creator and Marketing Helper

## 📚 Project Overview

## 🏗️ Architecture

Our platform is built on a modular, "Lego-like" architecture using Node.js and TypeScript. This approach offers several key benefits:

1. **Flexibility**: Components can be easily added, removed, or replaced.
2. **Scalability**: The system can grow and adapt to new requirements.
3. **Maintainability**: Isolated components are easier to update and debug.
4. **Reusability**: Components can be shared across different parts of the application or even in other projects.

### 🧩 Core Components (Lego Pieces)

1. **AI Model Interface**: A standardized way to interact with various AI models (e.g., Llama, GPT-4, Claude). ✅
2. **Story Generator**: Creates stories based on user inputs. ✅
3. **Story Evaluator**: Analyzes and provides feedback on stories. (In progress)
4. **Story Improver**: Offers suggestions to enhance stories. (In progress)
5. **Marketing Analyzer**: Identifies target audiences and creates marketing personas. (Planned)
6. **Social Media Content Creator**: Generates platform-specific social media content. (Planned)
7. **Marketing Concept Generator**: Develops marketing ideas and strategies. (Planned)

## 💻 Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js ✅
- **Language**: TypeScript ✅
- **AI Integration**: Customizable (currently supports Llama via Ollama, expandable to GPT-4, Claude, etc.) ✅
- **Frontend**: Vue.js ✅
- **Database**: MongoDB (planned)
- **Testing**: Jest ✅
- **Deployment**: Docker and Kubernetes (planned)

## 🛠️ Getting Started (for Developers)
