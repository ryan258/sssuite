## 7. User Experience (UX) Flow

1. User inputs initial story idea
2. AI generates 5 unique story presentation options
3. User selects preferred option
4. User creates initial content based on chosen option
5. AI enhances user's content
6. Content is evaluated and scored by AI
7. If score < 9/10, user receives improvement suggestions
8. User can rewrite or accept the content
9. Steps 5-8 repeat until content is finalized (score >= 9/10 or user accepts)
10. Marketing analysis and strategy development (future feature)
